            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This dish is one of the traditional Christmastime foods. These tamales are cooked in pairs called "piñas" and commonly eaten for breakfast or an afternoon snack. Usually shared with family, friends, and neighbors, these tamales are definitely a labor of love.</p>
            <p>The ingredients of these tamales can slightly differ from family to family or simply by personal preference, but generally they all have similarities. A bit of meat, a spoonful of rice, a pinch of this and a pinch of that, all gently nestled in a soft pillow of cornmeal dough and wrapped up tight in a banana leaf. Opening one up is just like opening up a present on Christams morning, you never really know what exactly will be in it!</p>

                    <li>Add tomaotes to reaming boiling water. Boil until the skins begin to split.</li>
                    <li>Once, tomatoes are ready, remove from water and transfer to blender. Liquify.</li>

                    <li>Add remaining beef broth and continue to mix. <strong>Note:</strong> You may not need all the broth. You are looking for a consistency that is slighty wet, but holds together well.</li>
                    <li>After broth has been added, slowly mix in lard, until you reach a desireable consistency.The consistency should be smooth, not gritty.</li>

                </ul>

            <h3>Assembly</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Before starting assmebly, this might be agood time to call over several friends or family memebers to help.</li>
                    <li>Set out all ingredients in an area large enought to fit everything, i.e. large kitchen table, large counter, etc.</li>
                    <li>Tear or cut banana leave into 2 sizes - Size 1: square based on the width of the leave Size 2: Rectangle using the width of the leave, opposite side should be a bit thinner than the width of the leave.</li>
                    <li>Lay the thinner rectangle on top (lines of leaves should be horizontal) of the larger square (lines of the leaves should be vertical)</li>
                    <li>Add some masa to the center of the leaves, about 1/2-3/4 cup depending on how large you want the tamales.</li>
                    <li>Flatten in the masa a bit and shape into a rough square-ish shape.</li>
                    <li>Add desired fillings rice, meat, sausage, olive, pepper, peas, carrot, prune, egg. Add as much of the fillings as you want, but remember the more you use, the harder it is to close the tamal.</li>
                    <li>After all fillings have been added, fold the leaves to close the tamal.</li>
                    <li>I prefer to fold the sides first, then fold over the top and bottom.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 3-7 for second tamal.</li>
                    <li>Once you have 2 tamales, place the folded sides together to make a bundle. Then using the twine, tie the tamales together like you are tying a ribbon on a present.</li>
                    <li>Place first "piña" or bundle in boiling water and cook for about 40-45 minutes. This will be your test batch to see how long they need to cook. If after 40-45 min they are not cooked to your liking, place back in water for abotu 15-20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>While the test batch is cooking contniue assmbly of the rest of the tamales.</li>
                    <li>Once all assembly is finished and the test batch is finished cooking, place the tamales in the boiling water to cook. This may need to be done in batched depending on the size of your pot and the number of bundles you have.</li>
                    <li>Cook for desired length of time.</li>
                    <li>Once the tamales are finished cooking remove from water and let cool for at least 3 hours. This will allow the masa to firm.</li>
                    <li> After the tamales have cooled, enjoy! Serve with extra Salsa Lizano (and hot sauce if you like). And don't forget to share with family and friends!</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>*The recipe for the masa should make between 60-100 tamales or 30-50 piñas, the amount of masa used will vary based on the size of the tamales.</li>
                    <li>**Used to make the texture of the masa smoother</li>
