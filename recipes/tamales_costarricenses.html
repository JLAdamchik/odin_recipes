            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This dish is one of the traditional Christmastime foods. These tamales are cooked in pairs called "pi√±as" and commonly eaten for breakfast or an afternoon snack. Usually shared with family, friends, and neighbors, these tamales are definitely a labor of love.</p>
            <p>The ingredients of these tamales can slightly differ from family to family or simply by personal preference, but generally they all have similarities. A bit of meat, a spoonful of rice, a pinch of this and a pinch of that, all gently nestled in a soft pillow of cornmeal dough and wrapped up tight in a banana leaf. Opening one up is just like opening up a present on Christams morning, you never really know what exactly will be in it!</p>
