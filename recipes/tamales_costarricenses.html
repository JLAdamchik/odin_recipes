            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This dish is one of the traditional Christmastime foods. These tamales are cooked in pairs called "piñas" and commonly eaten for breakfast or an afternoon snack. Usually shared with family, friends, and neighbors, these tamales are definitely a labor of love.</p>
            <p>The ingredients of these tamales can slightly differ from family to family or simply by personal preference, but generally they all have similarities. A bit of meat, a spoonful of rice, a pinch of this and a pinch of that, all gently nestled in a soft pillow of cornmeal dough and wrapped up tight in a banana leaf. Opening one up is just like opening up a present on Christams morning, you never really know what exactly will be in it!</p>
