                    <li>cooking oil</li>
                    <li>salt</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add about an inch or two of cooking oil to a large pot. Heat over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>While oil is heating begin preparing the planatins.</li>
                    <li>Begin by trimming the ends off the plantains, this helps with peeling off the skins.</li>
                    <li>Next using your knife, make a slit through the skin along the whole length of the plantain. Careful not to cut too deep into the flesh.</li>
                    <li>Now, remove the skin from the plaintain.</li>
                    <li>Once the skin has been removed, cut the plantain in to 4-5 large chunks (or more if you would like thinner, cripsier patacones).</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 3-6 for the other plantains.</li>
                    <li>Now that the oil is hot, place several pieces of plantain in the oil and cook for 4 minutes (or until they begin to turn golden brown) on top and bottom.</li>
                    <li>After two opposite sides are golden brown, using the bottom of a place, smash the warm plantains flat.</li>
                    <li>Return the flattened plantains to the hot oil and cook until desired crispiness.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oil and let drain on a paper towel lined plate or cooling rack.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle salt on top while still warm.</li>
                    <li>Repeat steps 8-12 for the other plantains.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
