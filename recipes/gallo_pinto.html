        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Gallo pinto is a traditional breakfast food in Costa Rica. Literally translated to mean "spotted rooster", this dish consists of rice and beans (the beans being the "spots") and spices. The most important of theses spices being the local seasoning sauce <a href="https://www.lizano.cr/productos/products/botella-lizano.html">Salsa Lizano.</a></p>
        <p>This dish can be found on the breakfast table in most homes in Costa Rica and definitely in almost all the typical restaurants called "sodas". This dish is often served alongside eggs, tortillas, fresh cheese, sweet fried plantains, natilla (the Costa Rican version of sour cream) and of course, fresh coffee. And if you're really lucky, sometimes bacon or sausage.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>2 tbps. neutral flavored oil; canola, vegetable, soy, etc</ul>
        <ul>1-2 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
        <ul>1/2 small onion, small diced</ul>
        <ul>2 cups cook white rice, day old preferred</ul>
        <ul>1 cup cooked black or red beans</ul>
        <ul>Some reserved liquid from the beans</ul>
        <ul>Salsa Lizano*, to taste</ul>
        <ul>Small handful fresh cilantro, rough chopped</ul>




        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>If you do not have access to Salsa Lizano, a steak sauce such as A1 has a similar flavor, but not exact. </ul>
